# CDS Expression Language (CXL) <UnderConstruction />

This document provides an overview of the CDS Expression Language (CXL) used in CDS models and queries.
CXL is essentially a standard subset of SQL expressions enhanced by [Path Expressions](../cds/cql#path-expressions) with [Infix Filters](../cds/cql#with-infix-filters).

The documentation is still **under construction** and will be released soon. 

For the time being, please refer to the existing reference docs about [CDS Query Language (CQL)](../cds/cql), and to the [CDS Expression Notation (CXN)](../cds/cxn) documentation.
