# Serving UIs from CAP Applications

CAP does not have its own UI technology, but can be used from a frontend built with any UI framework.
On top of that, there is out-of-the-box support for SAP Fiori elements, for example the Fiori annotations, and support for Fiori Drafts. This guide provides an overview of the available capabilities and points to further guides with more detailed information.
