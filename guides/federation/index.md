# Data Integration and Federation 

CAP applications can integrate and federate data from multiple external data sources, enabling seamless access and manipulation of distributed data. This guide provides an overview of the core concepts and techniques for implementing data federation in CAP applications, including service-level replication, HANA virtual tables, synonyms, and data products.

[ CAP-level Data Federation ](concepts.md)
   :   This guide introduces the fundamental concepts of data federation in CAP applications, explaining the various approaches and technologies available for integrating external data sources.  

[ Service-level Replication ](service-level-replication.md)
   :   This guide explains how to implement service-level replication in CAP applications, allowing data to be replicated from external services into the CAP application's own data model for improved performance and offline capabilities.

[ HANA Virtual Tables ](virtual-tables.md)
   :   This guide describes how to use HANA virtual tables in CAP applications to access and manipulate data stored in external databases as if it were part of the CAP application's own database.

[ HANA Synonyms ](synonyms.md)
   :   This guide covers the usage of HANA synonyms in CAP applications, enabling seamless integration with external database objects by creating synonyms that reference those objects within the CAP application's database schema.

[ HANA Data Products ](data-products.md)
   :   This guide explores the concept of HANA data products and how they can be utilized in CAP applications to encapsulate and manage data from various sources, providing a unified interface for data access and manipulation.
